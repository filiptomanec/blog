## Project Overview

The Travel Blog application consists of a homepage that displays a list of blog posts. Each post can be clicked on to
view its details. The detail view includes the post content and a list of comments. Users have the option to add their
own comments to each post. The application is serverless and preserves written comments upon refreshing the page (
Ctrl+R).

## Hosting and Deployment

The application is hosted at [http://filiptomanec.php5.cz](http://filiptomanec.php5.cz).<br/>
It is automatically updated after each push to the GitHub repository through GitHub Actions.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to create reusable UI components.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types to the language. TypeScript simplifies
  JavaScript code, making it easier to read and debug.
- **React Bootstrap**: Used for styling the application. It is a front-end framework that helps create responsive,
  mobile-first projects on the web.
- **Storybook**: A tool for developing UI components in isolation.
